# ☕ Coffeeshop – Triple Peaks

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a static web page for a fictional coffee shop called **Triple Peaks**.

The page includes:

- A header with logo, navigation menu, and slogan.
- A recipes section with embedded YouTube videos.
- A reservation form where users can enter name, number of guests, date/time, and email.
- A footer with social media links and copyright information.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** → semantic structure of the page
- **CSS3** → styling (flexible layout, Google Fonts, and basic responsiveness)
- **Accessibility best practices** → _alt_ attributes for images, _label_ for inputs, and focus for links

## 🔧 Future Improvements

Planned enhancements to make the page more interactive and professional:

- Advanced responsiveness with **media queries** for smaller screens (smartphones and tablets)
- **JavaScript form validation** to ensure required fields are filled in before submission
- **Real form integration** for processing reservations
- A **light/dark theme toggle button**
